# SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGING

[Module 1-Packaging evolution: From Basics to 3D Integration](#Module-1)

## MODULE 1

Why semiconductor packaging required?

* Semiconductor packaging is essential to protect the die from corrosion, moisture, and physical damage, and to enable connections to other components. It tranforms a fragile bare die into a functional part of real-world electronic systems like the iphone.
